# Documentation for Systems Librarianship Spring 2024

Here is where all the documentation for what we learn in this class will go. I will continue to add to this with each 
week as we learn and notes will be displayed and updated accordingly. 

### Week 1: 

- We created our **Google Cloud** accounts and a new *virtual machine* instance.
- The instance uses **Ubuntu** as its OS, and the **Gcloud SDK Shell** for its *command line*.[^1]
- We also created a *snapshot* of the instance before anything serious can be done with it, just in case it needs to be reset. 

### Week 2: 

- We learned how to set up a **GitHub** account and create a new *repository*.[^2]
- Additionally, we learned about **Markdown syntax**. I've demonstrated my knowledge of Markdown in the updated [readme file](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/blob/master/README.md) for this repository.
- From now on, each week's notes will be in Markdown complete with lists or tables.
- **Bold** text is reserved for headers and important technologies referenced in class. *Italicized* text is reserved for important terminology.
- Footnotes, images, links, and more will be provided where appropriate.[^3]

### Week 3: 

- The two ways a computer is typically used are via a *Graphical User Interface* or *GUI* and the less common, *Command Line Interface* or *CLI.*
- A GUI is primarily focused on interactions that aren't text based, while a CLI is mostly made up of text based interactions.[^4]
- A command line used with **Linux** is called a *Shell*. This is technically both a *command language* as well as a type of *scripting language*.
- The command language we're using right now is called **Bash**. A list of basic commands for Linux Shell's like Bash are as follows:

[^1]: In the command line, the commands to update the VM instance in Ubuntu are 
  `sudo apt update`
  and
  `sudo apt -y upgrade`
[^2]: As per the updated readme file, this account and repository have been revived 
  for the purposes of this course. 
[^3]: Footnotes will be used for additional specification of details, or code and commands not featured in the notes. 
  This may also include captions for images. 
[^4]: There is a trade off here between the requirement for a higher standard of user specificity and a greater degree of user control. The more detail that an interface requires, the more likely that it will perform intended operations accurately, although, this tends to make them inherently less friendly to the lay user.
