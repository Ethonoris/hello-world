# Documentation for Systems Librarianship Spring 2024

Here is where all the documentation for what we learn in this class will go. I will continue to add to this with each 
week as we learn and notes will be displayed and updated accordingly. 

### Week 1: 

- We created our **Google Cloud** accounts and a new *virtual machine* instance.
- The instance uses **Ubuntu** as its OS, and the **Gcloud SDK Shell** for its *command line*.[^1]
- We also created a *snapshot* of the instance before anything serious can be done with it, just in case it needs to be reset. 

### Week 2: 

- We learned how to set up a **GitHub** account and create a new *repository*.[^2]
- Additionally, we learned about **Markdown syntax**. I've demonstrated my knowledge of Markdown in the updated readme file for this repository.
- From now on, each week's notes will be in Markdown complete with lists or tables.
- **Bold** text is reserved for headers and important technologies referenced in class. *Italicized* text is reserved for important terminology.
- Footnotes, images, links, and more will be provided where appropriate.[^3]




[^1]: In the command line, the commands to update the VM instance in Ubuntu are 
  `sudo apt update`
  and
  `sudo apt -y upgrade`
[^2]: As per the updated readme file, this account and repository have been revived 
  for the purposes of this course. 
[^3]: Footnotes will be used for additional specification of details, or code and commands not featured in the notes. 
  This may also include captions for images.
