	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the key challenges of academic libraries in times of changing nature of higher education system and how library leaders can manage the challenges when effective leadership is highly required for academic libraries today. As the time is changing, the kinds of challenges that library leaders face have also changed. Author of this study explores the methods and approaches, which are more effective ways of managing challenges in the reshaping environment of academic libraries. At the same time, change has become a permanent part of academic libraries and they need leaders who are able to lead and manage change efficiently, bring theories into practices, find innovative solutions to challenges, creative thinkers, effective communicators, collaborative mindset and self-motivators. Design/methodology/approach: The selective publications have been reviewed to find the best ways to leading changes and managing challenges in academic libraries. The approaches and methods in this study are based on personal experiences of author as director of the university libraries and experiences of library leadership worldwide are conversed. Findings: Academic libraries are facing similar challenges around the world. The author found that academic library leadership needs innovative skills and competencies, effective communication abilities and a new way of thinking to deal with challenges and create willingness to adapt the changes. Kotter’s leadership manage change model may apply for creating and implementing organizational change in academic libraries. Originality/value: Literature on this topic is comparatively limited. Consequently, this manuscript adds value to the publications of library and information sciences and offers the literature in the field of leadership challenges and manage change in the academic libraries. It also provides guidelines to academic library leadership universally, and how can leaders work with change effectively. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This article examines the significance of dialogic exploration of feminist and diversity-oriented texts in book clubs consisting of Library and Information Science (LIS) master’s students at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa. Through this research, I sought to achieve an understanding of how participation in book clubs that espouse a feminist or diversity ethic inspire members to create deeper, more insightful connections between these values and LIS. While the two book clubs under study began as separate entities with distinct memberships, participants’ dual membership increased over time. The initially distinct ideals of each book club—feminism and diversity—coalesced, and a new value schema emerged in common between the two: a feminist diversity ethic. A feminist diversity ethic is a form of intersectional feminism that values experiential knowledge, the multifaceted nature of identity, respectful communication, caring, and orientation toward social justice as a means of dismantling interlocking systems of oppression. In the book clubs, this ethic encouraged the proactive search for exposure to diverse cultural and experiential paradigms through texts and stories of lived experience. Emphasis on this ethic informed book club members’ approach to LIS in several ways: first, it challenged participants to define diversity and its importance in LIS; second, it fostered the deconstruction of the notion of the other; and third, it enabled participants to actualize a feminist diversity ethic within the structure of the book clubs, thus preparing them to continue this ethic in their future roles as LIS practitioners. © 2019 Master of Library Science Program, East Carolina University},

	abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this article is to analyze the historical significance of Donald J. Urquhart, who established the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) that later was merged into the British Library Lending Division (BLLD), now called the British Library Document Supply Centre (BLDSC). Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a short history of the probabilistic revolution, particularly as it developed in the UK in the form of biometric statistics due to Darwin's theory of evolution. It focuses on the overthrow of the normal paradigm, according to which frequency distributions in nature and society conform to the normal law of error. The paper discusses the importance of the Poisson distribution and its utilization in the construction of stochastic models that better describe reality. Here the focus is on the compound Poisson distribution in the form of the negative binomial distribution (NBD). The paper then shows how Urquhart extended the probabilistic revolution to librarianship by using the Poisson as the probabilistic model in his analyses of the 1956 external loans made by the Science Museum Library (SML) as well as in his management of the scientific and technical (sci/tech) journal collection of the NLL. Thanks to this, Urquhart can be considered as playing a pivotal role in the creation of bibliometrics or the statistical bases of modern library and information science. The paper relates how Urquhart's son and daughter-in-law, John A. and Norma C. Urquhart, completed Urquhart's probabilistic breakthrough by advancing for the first time the NBD as the model for library use in a study executed at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, connecting bibliometrics with biometrics. It concludes with a discussion of Urquhart's Law and its probabilistic implications for the use of sci/tech journals in a library system. Findings - By being the first librarian to apply probability to the analysis of sci/tech journal use, Urquhart was instrumental in the creation of modern library and information science. His findings force a probabilistic re-conceptualization of sci/tech journal use in a library system that has great implications for the transition of sci/tech journals from locally held paper copies to shared electronic databases. Originality/value - Urquhart's significance is considered from the perspective of the development of science as a whole as well as library and information science in particular. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

A core journal list for systems librarianship was built based on Bradford analysis. Three effective ways to utilize CAS by table of contents (TOCs) alerts were identified. To keep up to date with the latest literature in the field of interest, LIS professionals should take advantage of CAS. The study found three effective ways to utilize CAS by TOCs alerts and identified core journals for systems librarianship.

	abstract = {Public library staff are increasingly required to work with members of the public with high social needs. Public libraries are places of sanctuary and connection for people experiencing challenges such as homelessness, poverty, mental illness, domestic violence and substance abuses. In recognizing their role to serve the needs of all people who enter their buildings, public library staff are often asked to work outside their areas of expertise to meet the needs of community members. Public library staff can experience feeling overwhelmed and anxious when working with this community, often wanting to help but not knowing where the boundary between providing support and undermining the self-determination of the individual lies, and not knowing what resources and services would best meet the needs of these visitors. To assist patrons with high social needs and library staff, the City of Melbourne Libraries followed an approach now common in the United States of America, but largely untested in Australia by working with a local housing group to place a social worker in their City Library. This article explores the early work of the Library Social Worker as she engaged with library patrons and provided training to library staff. Using statistics and case notes that describe her activities and their outcomes, we can see that although this practice is new for the Australian public library system, the placement of a social worker into a busy urban library has significant benefits to both patrons in need and the staff who work with them. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, from 2000 onwards, student enrolment began to drop and some programmes closed, producing a crisis in the studies on offer, which is yet to end. The evolution of LIS education in Spanish universities over 40 years is analy-sed and its future is evaluated based on the opinions of academic leaders from Spanish university centres that offer LIS degrees. The article aims to provide a detailed analysis of the opportunities, threats and necessary priorities in the field and a general assessment of its chances of remaining an independent discipline. 23 interviews were carried out with lecturers of the Spanish university system, and a Likert questionnaire was responded by 34 experts. Disappointments are noted: loss of interest in the subject, failure to generate academic and professional visibility, and failure to take advan-tage of technological change to position the field in the mainstream. Opportunities: orienting the degree course toward new topics, and prioritising postgraduate programmes. Threats: loss of students, failure to convey the value of the discipline to society, and failure to redefine its profile. Priorities: adapting current qualifications more closely to needs, participating in European research projects, and adopting technological change. More than 60% of the respondents agree that Library and Information science will remain an independent discipline in the short and medium term, while 20% disagree, although they do not see this as a problem. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

In information exposition coupled with the electronic or virtual era has brought a great change to libraries and its working environment. In today’s working environment the role of libraries and librarians changed from storehouse of information caretaker to information manager and at the same time the forms and distribution of information also took a new shape in a new way. This is due to the advancement of ICT as well as contemporary societal need. Due to this change, library and information science professionals also need a number of special skills and competencies along with the basic skills and competencies.

These include information technology, the role of the library as place, users’ values, and users’ naïveté about the complexity of information. Significant user values include immediacy, interactivity, personalization, and mobility. In order to develop services that respond to users’ need, librarians need to develop an anthropological understanding of their user communities. They also need to play a significant role in developing information systems. These need to provide personalized service. These ideas are not new; however, information technology has advanced to a point where they can be applied both practically and effectively. As librarians take a larger role in adapting information technologies to meet users’ information needs in ways that respond to their values, reference service must remain user-centered; high-tech and high touch are equally important. © 2003, MCB UP Limited},

A simple opinion poll was utilized for data collection. Librarians from two geopolitical zones in Nigeria were selected to form a sample for the study. Opinions were gathered on a 100 percent response rate. Findings revealed that academic libraries in Nigeria, even in their partial automated stages, aspire toward full automation, which also reflected the urgent need for system librarians trained in computer science and in library and information science to oversee the automation projects. It is therefore recommended that computer coding should be made a requirement for librarians in training: furthermore, librarians should embrace knowledge sharing and networking. This can be realized through continuous training and retraining on a compulsory annual sponsorship for librarians in library-based computer training programs.  © 2020 Common Ground Research Networks, Helen Uzoezi Emasealu, All Rights Reserved.},

Strategies include: seeking targeted donations from publishers, granting organizations, individuals, and others; intelligently exploiting non-targeted donations; utilizing volunteers; carefully balancing preservation and access; and implementing a basic inventory/circulation system. Research limitations/implications - Similar case studies undertaken at other libraries would add to the sparse literature on restricted budget and international school library collection development. Practical implications - International and domestic school libraries facing a restricted budget will gain concrete advice on collection development.

It also aims to stress the ways of human resources development in the academic librarianship of Serbia. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical method is implemented in this paper. Findings - This article shows how librarians in Serbia follow world positive practice and adjust themselves in order to achieve higher levels of professional competence. Research limitations/implications - The bibliography of researchers is pointed out as an achievement in the Serbian academic environment which is very important for the development of collaboration between readers in a professional field and researchers. Practical implications - Human resources managers in academic libraries may rely on the experience of Serbian librarians and implement those solutions they would estimate the most useful for their academic practice. Social implications - Some results of librarians' work are to be found in free access. These are the results of cataloguing and subject indexing through which librarians also contribute to global knowledge. Generally speaking librarians instruct users in the information society; therefore, the professional environment should create conditions for permanent improvement of human resources quality in academic libraries.

We also analyse current and future main digital development plans, projects and the most important related professional activities of Hungarian libraries. Emphasis is placed on information systems promoting cooperation between libraries and the issues of the National Library System Project, which is a large-scale modernisation programme carried out between 2016 and 2018, designed to develop the IT system of the National Széchényi Library. After introducing the information systems of academic and specialised libraries and the access models of scientific databases provided by multinational and Hungarian content services, we also discuss the endeavours of public libraries aiming for multifunctionality and community organisation.

Relying on interviews with twenty-four library staff at three public library systems in the Midwest United States and Gieryn's (1983) boundary work theory, this project focuses on the information public librarians provide to people experiencing homelessness. It also argues that public librarians navigate tensions in professional and personal boundaries, and that some of these tensions can be attributed to perceptions of vulnerability in both themselves and in the patrons they assist. The paper concludes by making arguments to consider the importance of self-care and building resilience in the profession of public librarianship. It also suggests the value of partnerships that enable public library staff to re-conceptualize what their professional roles entail.

Findings: This study found that web-based polling in a library instruction classroom benefits both students and instructors. The students enjoy these sessions and are more attentive than in a typical lecture, which leads to better learning. Instructors are able to learn about the students' uses of technology, research methods, and more with the polling capability. Research limitations/implications: The research in this study was only done using the free version of Poll Everywhere in management classes. It would be interesting to see if the results would be the same in other business classes as well as non-business classes. It could also be beneficial to test the functionality of paid accounts as well as seeing how other web sites compare. Practical implications: This article may assist those deciding between different audience response systems and provide tips to those wishing to implement web-based polling, and more specifically Poll Everywhere, in their sessions. Originality/value: Few articles on audience response systems exist solely on web-based polling and the benefits instructors can reap in addition to their students. This research will be of benefit to any librarian who teaches in the classroom, especially those in academic libraries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: The authors examined 70 advertisements for technology-focused librarians posted on ALA’s JobList in 2014. The ads were examined for area of focus and required knowledge and experiences. Findings: The ads revealed three main areas of focus: traditional systems, digital initiatives, and web services. In addition to traditional computer and library systems skills, employers were seeking candidates with project management, digital collection, customer service, technology implementation, and problem solving skills and experience. Practical implications: This study highlights how the adoption and expansion of library technology has altered the roles and responsibilities of systems librarians. Instead of solely focusing on maintaining library databases and ILSs, technology librarians have branched out and become more integrated within the library.

However, the framework for planning and implementing a hybrid e-learning model is unclear in the literature. Using a routines-based perspective, e-learning opportunities were explored through identifying the internal difficulties of a part-time LIS postgraduate programme in Taiwan. External challenges were also examined. A practical implication of the findings is a planning and implementation framework for hybrid e-learning, namely 'the Four Elements model' and the 'Structure-System-Process paradigm', respectively. The former includes four core competencies: cost, service, quality and flexibility needed for LIS educators to formulate an action plan. The latter demonstrates how and what resources can be deployed to implement the action plan. With the framework, a part-time LIS postgraduate programme with limited e-learning courses is generally expected to develop a competitive advantage. © The Author(s), 2010.},

This paper aims to reveal the efficacy of this inclusive human-focused approach for building systems through user-generated research examples. Design/methodology/approach - From 2003 to 2006, user-centered interaction design guided increasingly complex human-computer interaction projects at California Polytechnic State University. Toward that end, project planners invite polytechnic students, supervised by computer science professors, to assess peers' information seeking needs. This student-generated evidence informs creation of paper prototypes and implementation of usability tests. Sustained relationships between planners and beneficiaries permit iterative evaluation and continuous improvement of design concepts and product functionalities. Findings û Purposeful conversations aimed at learning from user-generated evidence enrich the planning process for digital library projects. Reflective of the olearn by doing educational values of the organization, this approach advances learning among both users and planners throughout user-centered (re)design experiences. Practical implications - Collaborative design assumes that enabling interfaces, systems, and environments are best designed and developed inclusively, with and for beneficiaries. Toward that end, practical guidelines are offered to enable replication of this approach, which depends on user produced and interpreted evidence, in other organizational settings. Originality/value - A paucity of literature exists on the relevance of EBL in the digital age. Similarly, too little applied research has adopted a human-centered focus for design and development of information systems. Finally, too few digital library projects recognize the value of initiating positive user experiences at project inception.},

This article becomes pertinent because few studies have examined academic libraries' planning documents to see how they are prioritizing among the competing issues and challenges facing them in the last two decades. This paper addresses the gap in the literature, theory and practice. The paper argued that effective strategic planning involves understanding the library domain, assessing relevant resource base and creating a shared view of the future, by asking fundamental questions such as what do libraries need to do to support excellence in service delivery and remain competitive in any academic environment?. This paper argued that strategic planning involves gathering and processing information, identifying and evaluating options, deciding and refining objectives, formulating and implementing plans, monitoring and reviewing progress. Through a content analysis of academic library strategic plans, the paper discovered the extent to which strategic planning principles are monitoring and addressing emerging and traditional needs of the library and its service delivery. The paper concludes that library leaders and the planning team should work together to develop an effective system for ensuring the commitment of all library staff to strategies of their libraries. © 2021, Library Philosophy and Practice.

It describes the changes of educational goals of Czechoslovak librarianship in the reporting period and methods used in educational activities. In the period after the end of WWII, Czechoslovak librarianship continued its development, especially in the legislative area, on the foundations built during the 1918–1938 period. Even in the post-war period, the General Public Libraries Act remained in force and there was a coordination center for educational activities which after the end of the war adopted its original name - Masaryk Institute of Adult Education. However, after 1945, training and public librarianship were in a completely different social and political situation. The field of adult education and the public librarianship remained priority areas of interest for political representation and individual political parties that operated in post-war Czechoslovakia. The political representation of post-war Czechoslovakia cooperated intensively with the USSR, and the left-wing ideas had very strong position in the political and public life of the state. In the first part of the article, we study the efforts of the communists in the period 1945–1948 to control the public libraries, which were one of the most important elements of the educational system and were of importance, especially in the rural environment. The second part of the article focuses on the period 1948–1959.

A structured questionnaire, listing 84 competency statements, covering eight areas, prepared after extensive literature review, expert scrutiny and pilot testing, using a 5-point Likert scale was distributed among the head librarians and chairpersons of library committees (CLC) in 115 medical libraries. Results: Sixty seven (58%) useable responses were received from head librarians and 63 (55%) from CLC. Of the 84 competency statements 83 were validated by the head librarians, 44 receiving four or higher mean score while the other 39 statements getting mean scores in the range of 3.97 and 3.06. The CLC validated 80 statements. Only 27 statements received four or higher mean score from CLC while the other 53 got mean scores in the range of 3.97 and 3.22. Conclusions: Medical librarians are required to be well versed with all those competencies which are needed for general librarianship. In addition, they are expected to have adequate knowledge of health sciences environment including medical terminologies and concepts.

Unlike most other visiting programs in the U.S., UCF's hosting experience offers a year-long, broad-based training in several functional areas facilitated by library administration and two bilingual librarians. The initial goals were to promote dialogue and understanding between the academic systems of the two countries, and ultimately to enhance the international users' library experience in their quest to study at foreign institutions. Through describing this visiting program and discussing its findings and assessments, the authors concluded longer term visiting programs like this can benefit both the visiting and hosting libraries and bridge the gap of academic libraries across the world. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © Jing Xu, Ying Zhang, and Sai Deng.},

Specifically, the forms of training, level of proficiency in requisite ICT skills as well as the ability to perform the roles of systems librarians by librarians in the systems department of academic libraries in some universities in Nigeria were examined. The results revealed that most systems librarians in Nigeria acquire their training through self studies, colleagues and on the job and that their proficiency both in the requisite ICT skills and their ability to perform their specialized roles is low. The study demonstrated that the low proficiency in the requisite ICT skills possessed by the respondents accounted proportionately for their poor proficiency in performing their roles as systems librarians.

At first, the mediation concept is presented in its different manifestations, privileging its horizontal and vertical axis. Then, it was undertaken a panoramic study on abstracts of full articles published about that theme in 11 LIS, six Museology, two Archival Science and one Information Systems Journals, in the last ten years (articles published from january 2007 to October 2017). Through content analysis of those abstracts, it is possible to affirm the great variety of concepts and approaches of mediation. The general mediation concept is wide and generic, and has been approached in LIS and Museology, in reference as to macrosocial processes about the role of museums and library in social order, covering cultural actions, as to institutional process related do document organizing, and also situational processes related to educative actions and services offered to users and publics. By their turn, Archival Science Journals modestly present the theme, which one is almost absent in Information System Journals. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Campinas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examined the concept of strategic planning in librarianship. This article becomes pertinent because few studies have examined academic libraries' planning documents to see how they are prioritizing among the competing issues and challenges facing them in the last two decades. This paper addresses the gap in the literature, theory and practice. The paper argued that effective strategic planning involves understanding the library domain, assessing relevant resource base and creating a shared view of the future, by asking fundamental questions such as what do libraries need to do to support excellence in service delivery and remain competitive in any academic environment?. This paper argued that strategic planning involves gathering and processing information, identifying and evaluating options, deciding and refining objectives, formulating and implementing plans, monitoring and reviewing progress. Through a content analysis of academic library strategic plans, the paper discovered the extent to which strategic planning principles are monitoring and addressing emerging and traditional needs of the library and its service delivery. The paper concludes that library leaders and the planning team should work together to develop an effective system for ensuring the commitment of all library staff to strategies of their libraries. © 2021.

	abstract = {The role of information within management is in a state of dramatic transformation. Managers must grasp and act on the implications of this change if they are to maintain their competitive position both corporately and as individuals. Information technology continues to develop at an exponential rate. But it is only an extension of what has gone before, and should be understood and used in this light. Vastly more information relevant to managers is now accessible than ever before, particularly through the use of electronic databases and networks. A selective listing of major business information databases is provided. Individual managers, whatever their function, must learn to take full advantage of the information resources available to them, and do so continuously as part of their management techniques. Organisations must develop an information strategy and corporate structure which ensures the fullest use of internal and external resources. The position of the librarian within this overall task remains well-placed, although his relevance and role remain very much a question for his own initiative. © 1989, MCB UP Limited.

	abstract = {This paper provides a research perspective on developing information communication technology (ICT) in service to women and their communities. The activities which produce women's information are those which primarily serve, examine, and/or enhance the lives of women. ICT, when well designed, can make a significant improvement in both the development and dissemination of this information. Three interdisciplinary constructs underpin the proposed ICT research: development of women's knowledge structures, patterns in women's communication, and gender-related technology response patterns. Knowledge structure research can improve the design of information storage and retrieval systems by reinforcing the mechanisms many women use to incorporate new information into their extant understanding. Socially constructed communication patterns can provide a substantive array of strategies and tactics for women to use in sharing information, Understanding technology response patterns can improve ICT design and development as well as its deployment by supporting adaptation to both individual and community situations. Each of these three constructs is carefully explained in terms of both theory and current research. Finally, a three-part research agenda is proposed as the next stage in the cohesive, interdisciplinary, international development of women's information communication technology.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the "retro" image often awarded them, and despite their continuing enthusiasm and responsibility for the organization of printed materials, librarians are upbeat about the prospects of an information society driven primarily by electronic technologies, but in which libraries can play an important part. Public librarians detect a natural correlation between the historic democratic mission of their institution and the increased accessibility made possible by digitalized sources. The library community's acceptance of the information society idea as a "given" social phenomenon supports discourses that play down historical continuities and herald the dawn of a new age. Such discourses ignore or reject historical evidence that points to the existence of past information societies, revolutions, and infrastructures denned, in part, by the operation of indirect surveillance, constituted by the bureaucratic information systems of modernity. Victorian Britain serves as a good example of an early information society, to which public libraries, themselves micro-information societies, contributed significantly. The role played by public librarians in the Victorian information society, illustrated in this article by evidence drawn from the contemporary library press, is seen in their preoccupation with the surveillance and ordering of knowledge; their adoption for library operations of the businesslike, bureaucratic procedures described recently by business historians; and their panoptic tracking of users and their activities.},

Library governance, staffing, expertise, and resource and funding availability all played roles in directing a total site redesign. In addition, the organizational structure for a decentralized, multi-campus Web site needed to be reconciled with the Web platform chosen for the redesign. Ultimately, the authors determined that LibGuides, traditionally used for creating research guides, could be the foundation of a new Web site. In fact, the flexibility and unique features of LibGuides allowed them to easily adapt it to serve a five-campus library system. A description of the redesign process is given with emphasis on features that were appealing to the authors and their local circumstances. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Participatory design (PD) is a user-centered design method that can support librarians in the democratic development of digital learning spaces. However, while PD has been used in libraries, we have little knowledge of how youth librarians can act as codesign partners. We need a conceptual model to understand the role of youth librarians in codesign, and how their experiences are integrated into youth design partnerships. To generate this model, we examine a case study of the evolutionary process of a single librarian and the development of a library system's learning activities through PD. Using the idea of equal design partnerships, we analyzed video recordings and stakeholder interviews on how children (ages 7–11) worked together with a librarian to develop new digital learning activities. Our discussion focuses on the development of a participatory librarian design conceptual model that situates librarians as design partners with youth. The article concludes with recommendations for integrating PD methods into libraries to create digital learning spaces and suggestions for moving forward with this design perspective. © 2019 ASIS&T},
