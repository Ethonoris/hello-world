## Week 8: 

- Now an *HTML form* is needed to enter queries into the OPAC.
- We'll use the code below but you want to make sure that the stand-in for the external IP address is replaced with your actual one.

```
<html>
<head>
<title>MySQL Server Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>A Basic OPAC</h1>

<p>In the form below,
<b>optionally</b> enter text in the search field.
You can search by author, title, or publisher.
Capitalization is not necessary.
It's okay to enter partial information,
like part of an author's, title's, or publisher's name.</p>

<p>The date fields are <b>required</b>.
You can use the date fields to limit results.
I added some extra records,
which you can view to know what you can query:</p>

<p><a href="http://11.111.222.222/opac.php">http://11.111.222.222/opac.php</a></p>

<p>This is very much a toy,
stripped down
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_public_access_catalog">OPAC</a>.
The records are basic.
Not only do they not conform to
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/marc/">MARC</a>,
but they don't even conform to something
as simple as
<a href="https://www.dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>.

<p>I also don't provide options
to select different fields,
like author, title, or publisher fields.
Instead the search field below searches
all the fields
(author, title, publisher)
in our <b>books</b> table.</p>

<p>The key idea is to get a sense
of how an OPAC works, though.</p>

<h2>My Basic Library OPAC</h2>
<form method="post" action="search.php">
    <label for="search">Search:</label>
    <input type="text" name="search" id="search">
    <br>
    <label for="start_date">Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="start_date" id="start_date">
    <br>
    <label for="end_date">End Date:</label>
    <input type="date" name="end_date" id="end_date">
    <br>
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>


</body>
</html>
```

- Next, we'll create the search.php file that is referenced in the previous code.
- Again, we replace the stand-in IP with the actual one.
```
<?php
// Load MySQL credentials
require_once 'login.php';

// Establish connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($db_hostname, $db_username, $db_password) or
  die("Unable to connect");

// Open database
mysqli_select_db($conn, $db_database) or
  die("Could not open database '$db_database'");

// Check if search query was submitted
if (isset($_POST['search'])) {
    // Sanitize user input to prevent SQL injection attacks
    $search = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['search']);

    // Get the start and end dates for the date range
    $start_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['start_date']);
    $end_date = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['end_date']);

    // Build the MySQL query with a WHERE
    // clause that includes the date range filter
    $query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE
        (author LIKE '%$search%' OR
        title LIKE '%$search%' OR
        publisher LIKE '%$search%') AND
        copyright BETWEEN '$start_date' AND '$end_date'";

    // Execute the query
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

    // Check if any results were returned
    if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
        // Loop through the results and output them
        while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
            echo "ID: " . $row["id"] . "<br>";
            echo "Author: " . $row["author"] . "<br>";
            echo "Title: " . $row["title"] . "<br>";
            echo "Publisher: " . $row["publisher"] . "<br>";
            echo "Copyright: " . $row["copyright"] . "<br><br>";
        }
    } else {
        echo "No results found.";
    }

    // Free up memory by closing the MySQL result set
    mysqli_free_result($result);
}

// Close the MySQL connection
mysqli_close($conn);

echo "<p>Return to search page: <a href='http://11.111.222.222/mylibrary.html'>http://11.111.222.222/mylibrary.html</a></p>";

?>
```

- Now we can test it!

![OPAC2](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/assets/44278023/e06b2c31-0e2d-403c-8539-e9287228ad56)

![OPAC3](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/assets/44278023/af159d3c-1aa3-4d0c-af3e-ea8676ed0aa1)

- Looks like it works! Now we can add more books to the database.
- By logging into MySQL as opacuser with the password from before we can add to it.
- Five books were added as per the SQL statement below:

```
insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Elizabeth Shepherd', 'Archives and Archivists in 20th Century England', 'Routledge', '2016-04-08'),
('John Ray', 'The Rosetta Stone and the Rebirth of Ancient Egypt', 'Harvard University Press', '2012-04-02'),
('Marilyn Johnson', 'This Book Is Overdue! How Librarians and Cybrarians Can Save Us All', 'HarperCollins Publishers', '2011-01-25'),
('Philippa Mein Smith', 'A Concise History of New Zealand', 'Cambridge University Press', '2012-02-06'),
('Tom Nichols', 'The Death of Expertise', 'Oxford University Press', '2024-03-06');
```
- Now let's try to pull one up!

![OPAC4](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/assets/44278023/248c2289-ac5f-4ddb-a1d5-2251895ee876)

![OPAC5](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/assets/44278023/70673ead-1297-40cc-9a5b-99e46dc9f470)

- But what happens if you enter something generic? Will we get multiple results?

![OPAC6](https://github.com/Ethonoris/hello-world/assets/44278023/bb4e887d-de7c-44a3-ac44-ec9d7e72a308)

- Yes, that's perfect!
