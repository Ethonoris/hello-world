# SysLib Spring 2024

This is a revival of a GitHub account I have not used since **2018**! 

It is also serving to demonstrate my knowledge of *markdown*.

> Editor's note: This readme master file is the same one I used in 2018 for several of my web technology associate's degree courses.
> Although the code I did for many assignments in those classes is long gone, part of the original readme file and its branch have
> been preserved as branches to this new version of the master. There's not much left to see there sadly.

## My experience with GitHub and code/text editors

In my past experiences, we would often code in other text and code editors before uploading them to GitHub so directly coding in GitHub 
was not usually necessary. One of my favorites was [PSPad](http://www.pspad.com/en/) due to the ability to store it on a ***USB flash drive*** 
and run it from there!

Here is a picture of my cat, Mona Lisa, just to see if I know how to get this to work with markdown in GitHub:

### Programming and Coding

Here are some programming and markup languages I had worked with in the past that I still remember decently well: 

1. HTML and CSS
2. XML
3. Javascript
4. PHP[^1]

On the other hand, here are some I've worked with that I'm more than a little rusty with: 

- Java
- C++
- SQL[^2]

`Here is where I would put some code if I felt like it.`












[^1]: More or less. 
[^2]: This one I think will come back to me quicker than some of the others.
